# Methods

This study uses an observational, comparative country-level design to examine how changes in forest area, land‑use emissions and the energy system relate to the fossil CO₂ intensity of gross domestic product in South America. The empirical strategy combines harmonised official statistics for twelve countries with a simple decadal‑change framework and linear regression models. The analysis is framed in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular goals on affordable and clean energy, climate action, life on land, food systems and institutions.

The study area comprises twelve South American countries, identified by their ISO3 codes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela. National territories and population counts follow the definitions used by the data providers. The temporal scope is restricted to three benchmark years, 2000, 2010 and 2020, which offer sufficiently consistent coverage across data sources. Decadal changes are defined over the 2000–2010 and 2010–2020 intervals. The resulting analysis panel contains thirty‑six country–year observations in levels and twenty‑four country–period observations in decadal differences.

## Data sources and indicators

We construct a harmonised country–year panel by combining data from CEPALSTAT, the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and FAOSTAT. All variables are aggregated to the national level and aligned on a common calendar‑year basis. Where original series are provided in alternative units, we standardise them to physically interpretable units such as thousand hectares, tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, kilograms of CO₂ per unit of output, or population‑weighted rates.

From CEPALSTAT we obtain forest area, fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of gross domestic product at purchasing power parity, the share of agriculture in value added, the share of terrestrial and marine protected areas, the Gini index and the incidence of rural extreme poverty. Forest area is measured as total forest area per country in thousand hectares. Fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP is expressed as kilograms of CO₂ per constant 2017 international‑dollar of GDP in purchasing power parity terms, which is a standard indicator of energy‑related emission intensity. The agriculture value added share of GDP is used as a proxy for structural change in the economy. The protected areas share, the Gini index and rural extreme poverty serve as contextual variables and potential controls for social and institutional conditions where data are available.

World Bank World Development Indicators provide information on the energy system, macroeconomic structure, and governance. We use the percentage shares of electricity generated from hydropower, coal, natural gas, and non‑hydropower renewables, as well as the share of the population with access to electricity. Economic indicators include GDP per capita in constant 2017 international‑dollars at purchasing power parity, total GDP in constant 2015 US‑dollars and the percentage of GDP accounted for by oil rents. Demographic indicators comprise total population and population density. To characterise institutional quality, we draw on the Worldwide Governance Indicators for control of corruption and rule of law, which are available for most years in the study period.

Land‑use, agricultural and land‑use emissions data are taken from FAOSTAT bulk downloads in normalised format. We use crop and land‑use datasets to derive national time series for harvested area under soybeans, harvested area under sugarcane and permanent meadows and pastures. These areas are measured in hectares and converted to thousand‑hectare units for consistency with forest area. We combine fertiliser input data to obtain nitrogen fertiliser application rates in kilograms per hectare of agricultural land. From the FAOSTAT emissions totals dataset we extract total land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions, expressed as thousand tonnes of CO₂ equivalent based on the AR5 global warming potentials. These LULUCF totals form the basis for per‑capita land‑use emissions and their decadal changes.

CEPALSTAT and World Bank series are retrieved programmatically through their public application programming interfaces using dedicated Python clients. The clients query the indicator‑specific endpoints, request English‑language output in JSON format, and parse the resulting data cubes into tidy tabular structures with explicit country, year and indicator dimensions. FAOSTAT bulk files are downloaded once, stored locally, decompressed and read as comma‑separated values. For FAOSTAT we rely on the normalised format, which provides a stable layout of area, item and element codes across datasets and facilitates consistent filtering for the specific crops, land‑use categories and emission elements relevant to this study.

To support transparent reporting of the empirical design, all variables, units, transformations and data sources used in the analysis panels are summarised in a separate codebook. The codebook is linked to the master analysis panel and to the scripts that construct each derived variable.

## Data processing and construction of analysis panels

The extract–transform–load workflow is implemented as a sequence of modular Python scripts. Each script reads one or more input files, performs a clearly defined set of transformations and writes a new comma‑separated output file. This design ensures that all steps from raw data to the analysis panels are reproducible and can be re‑run if the underlying data are updated.

In a first step, we construct a basic forest–energy panel that combines total forest area and fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP from CEPALSTAT for all years with available data. Forest area and CO₂ intensity series are harmonised so that each record corresponds to a unique country–year combination. This base panel is then extended to include agriculture value added, land‑use variables derived from FAOSTAT, World Bank energy mix variables, governance indicators, social indicators and trade‑related measures. Each extension script merges its additional variables on country and year keys, checks for duplicate records and retains a single row per country–year.

The successive extensions yield a comprehensive “master” panel containing forest, energy, economic, land‑use, governance and social indicators at annual resolution. A final script adds total population and population density from the World Bank. To prepare the dataset for statistical analysis, we restrict the sample to the twelve South American countries of interest and the three benchmark years 2000, 2010 and 2020. We then generate an analysis‑ready version of the master panel by dropping variables that contain only missing values across all sample observations and by standardising variable names and units. This level panel forms the basis for descriptive statistics and visualisations.

Decadal change variables are derived from the same master panel. For each country, observations are sorted chronologically and differences between consecutive benchmark years are computed. The resulting delta panel contains one observation per country and decade, identified by the end year of the period and an indicator for the corresponding start year. As with the level panel, an analysis‑ready version of the delta panel is created by dropping variables with no non‑missing observations in the sample.

Throughout the processing pipeline we use consistent country identifiers, rely on transparent unit conversions and record all intermediate outputs on disk. No observations are imputed. Missing values in upstream sources appear as missing values in the merged panels, and statistical models are estimated on the largest subset of observations with complete data for the variables included in a given specification.

## Definition of decadal changes

Decadal changes are defined as first differences over approximately ten years. For each country, the change in a variable between 2000 and 2010 is calculated as the value in 2010 minus the value in 2000, and the change between 2010 and 2020 is calculated analogously. The resulting delta variables measure the net change over each decade rather than annual growth rates.

Forest area dynamics are captured through both absolute and relative changes. Absolute change in forest area is defined as the difference in thousand hectares between the end and start year of each decade. Percentage change in forest area is defined as the absolute change divided by the initial forest area level, multiplied by one hundred. This relative metric facilitates comparison across countries with very different forest area endowments. Changes in the fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP are measured in absolute terms as differences in kilograms of CO₂ per unit of GDP. Changes in the energy system are represented by differences in the percentage share of electricity generated from hydropower between the end and start years of each decade. This change in hydropower share reflects the contribution of hydropower expansion or contraction to the decarbonisation of the electricity mix.

Economic and structural transformation is represented by decadal changes in GDP per capita at purchasing power parity and in the agriculture value added share of GDP. The change in GDP per capita is defined in absolute terms, in constant 2017 international‑dollars, to capture the scale of income growth. The change in the agricultural share of GDP is defined in percentage points and provides a measure of structural change away from or towards agriculture. Together, these indicators characterise the joint evolution of economic development and sectoral structure.

Land‑use emissions are analysed in per‑capita terms. Total LULUCF emissions for each country and year are divided by total population to obtain per‑capita land‑use emissions in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per person. Decadal changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions are then defined as first differences of this per‑capita series. This construction ensures that the dependent variable in the LULUCF regressions reflects changes in land‑use emissions from the perspective of individuals while controlling for population growth. The delta panel thus includes both the level of per‑capita LULUCF emissions at the end of each decade and the change over the decade.

## Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis proceeds in two stages. In a first stage we use the level and delta panels to compute descriptive statistics and explore pairwise associations among key variables. For each benchmark year we calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of forest area, fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, LULUCF emissions, selected land‑use variables such as areas under soybeans, sugarcane and pasture, fertiliser use, GDP per capita and population density. We also compute correlation matrices for selected subsets of variables to characterise simple bivariate relationships. These descriptive analyses provide context but do not identify causal effects.

In a second stage we estimate linear regression models that relate decadal changes in fossil CO₂ intensity and in LULUCF emissions per capita to changes in forests, the energy system and economic structure. The sample size for the decadal models is limited by the number of countries and the requirement that both endpoints of a decade be observed for all variables included in a specification. All models are estimated by ordinary least squares using the delta panel and are cross‑sectional in the sense that each country–decade observation contributes at most one observation to a given regression.

To analyse changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP we estimate models in which the dependent variable is the absolute decadal change in CO₂ intensity. The principal specification relates this change to percentage change in forest area, change in the hydropower share of electricity generation and absolute change in GDP per capita at purchasing power parity. These regressions are estimated on the full set of country–decade observations with non‑missing values for all included variables, and also separately for the 2000–2010 and 2010–2020 decades to examine whether associations differ across periods. Standard errors are computed using conventional formulas and with heteroskedasticity‑consistent corrections, and results are checked for sensitivity to the exclusion of individual countries where sample size permits.

To analyse changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions we estimate models in which the dependent variable is the decadal change in LULUCF emissions per capita. The main specification relates this change to percentage change in forest area and change in the agriculture value added share of GDP. These regressions are estimated on the subset of countries for which LULUCF emissions and population data are available for both endpoints of at least one decade. Given the small sample size, we report conventional and heteroskedasticity‑consistent standard errors and examine the sensitivity of the estimates to clustering of standard errors by country and to re‑estimating the model while sequentially omitting each country from the sample.

The regression models are not intended to establish causal effects of forest change or the energy mix on emissions outcomes. Instead, they quantify conditional associations between decadal changes in key variables, conditional on the limited set of covariates available for all countries and decades in the sample. Interpretation of the estimated coefficients therefore focuses on direction and statistical significance rather than on structural parameters.

## Visualisation

To complement the numerical analysis we construct a set of article‑ready figures based on the level and delta panels. For each benchmark year we compute regional mean values of forest area, fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP and LULUCF emissions and present their evolution over time in a line chart. For the decadal analysis we produce scatterplots of percentage change in forest area against absolute change in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP and against change in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. Points are labelled by country and decade, and countries are grouped into simple clusters to aid visual comparison. Specifically, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are grouped as an agricultural Southern Cone cluster, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela as an Andean and Amazon‑frontier cluster, and Chile, Guyana and Suriname as a residual group of other countries. In addition, we summarise changes in the electricity mix between 2000 and 2020 in a figure that displays the change in hydropower, coal, gas and non‑hydropower renewables shares for each country.

All figures are generated by Python scripts that read the analysis panels, apply consistent plotting styles and export high‑resolution images for use in the article. The figures are designed to illustrate the core empirical patterns documented in the Results section and to provide an intuitive complement to the regression analysis described above.
