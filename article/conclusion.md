# Conclusion

This study analysed how changes in forest area, land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions and the electricity mix relate to the fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP in twelve South American countries between 2000 and 2020. By constructing harmonised country–year and decadal‑change panels from CEPALSTAT, World Development Indicators and FAOSTAT, and by estimating simple linear regressions on decadal differences, we documented how energy‑related and land‑use emissions have evolved along partly separate trajectories. The analysis shows that reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP are closely associated with changes in the electricity mix and income growth, while per‑capita LULUCF emissions remain tightly linked to forest area dynamics and the economic role of agriculture. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to consider both energy‑sector decarbonisation and land‑use emissions when assessing climate performance and designing mitigation strategies in South America.

For fossil CO₂ emissions, most countries experienced declines in emissions per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity over the two decades. The decadal regressions indicate that these reductions are significantly associated with increases in the hydropower share of electricity generation and with gains in GDP per capita, whereas percentage changes in forest area do not exhibit a statistically significant association with changes in fossil CO₂ intensity once energy and income dynamics are controlled for. This pattern is consistent with national and regional studies that emphasise the central role of low‑carbon electricity and structural economic change in decarbonising energy systems in South America. It suggests that, within the time frame and spatial scale considered here, energy‑system transitions and broader development processes, rather than forest dynamics, are the main drivers of changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP.

At the same time, the analysis of land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions paints a different picture. When LULUCF emissions are expressed in per‑capita terms and examined in decadal changes, they are closely associated with forest area dynamics and with the agriculture value added share of GDP. Country–periods with greater forest loss tend to experience larger increases in per‑capita LULUCF emissions, while declines in the agriculture share of GDP are associated with more favourable LULUCF trajectories. These relationships are stable across ordinary least squares estimates with heteroskedasticity‑consistent and cluster‑robust standard errors and remain qualitatively similar in leave‑one‑country‑out sensitivity tests, within the constraints imposed by the small sample size. The results therefore reinforce the view that forest conservation and the structure of agricultural production remain central to land‑use emissions in South America.

The country clusters introduced in the Results section help to situate these findings in the region’s heterogeneous development pathways. Countries in the agricultural Southern Cone group, such as Brazil and Paraguay, often combine low or declining fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP with substantial forest losses over one or both decades. Countries in the Andean and Amazon‑frontier group, including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, display more diversified energy mixes and higher average fossil CO₂ intensity, alongside continued forest dynamics at extractive and agricultural frontiers. The small residual group of Chile, Guyana and Suriname exhibits mixed profiles with varying combinations of forest change, energy mixes and emissions. Across these contexts, the empirical message is consistent: improvements in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP can coexist with continued forest loss, and favourable trends in energy‑related emissions do not automatically translate into favourable trends in land‑use emissions.

These findings have direct implications for how climate performance is monitored and for the interpretation of commonly used indicators. Measures such as fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of GDP are useful for tracking progress in energy‑sector decarbonisation, but they capture only part of the greenhouse gas balance in forest‑rich economies. In South America, where electricity generation is often relatively low in fossil carbon and land‑use emissions can be large, relying solely on fossil CO₂ intensity risks overstating progress towards climate mitigation. Our results provide an empirical illustration of this concern by showing that countries can reduce fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP through changes in the electricity mix and economic structure while LULUCF emissions per capita remain closely tied to forest loss and agricultural expansion. For policy analysis and international reporting, this underscores the importance of integrating land‑use emissions explicitly into assessments of climate performance.

The study also speaks to the interplay between climate mitigation and the Sustainable Development Goals. The observed decline in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, driven by changes in the electricity mix and improvements in energy access, aligns with SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. However, the persistence of forest loss and its tight link to per‑capita LULUCF emissions indicates that SDG 15, which calls for halting deforestation and reversing land degradation, remains under pressure in several countries. The association between changes in the agriculture share of GDP and LULUCF emissions highlights the tensions and potential synergies between SDG 2 on zero hunger and SDG 13: expanding agricultural output to improve food security and export revenues can either intensify land‑use emissions if achieved through area expansion, or contribute to mitigation if combined with intensification and improved practices. Finally, the descriptive variation in governance and social indicators across countries, and the supporting literature on institutional quality and emissions, underscore the relevance of SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions for both energy‑sector and land‑use mitigation.

Several limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting these conclusions. The analysis is based on twelve countries and three benchmark years, which constrains the number of country–decade observations and limits the complexity of regression specifications. The models rely on nationally aggregated data from international statistical agencies and do not capture subnational heterogeneity in land‑use change, energy systems or governance. The decadal‑difference design helps to focus on medium‑term changes and to abstract from time‑invariant country characteristics, but it cannot identify causal effects of forest change, hydropower expansion or income growth on emissions outcomes. In addition, the variable set is restricted by the coverage of the underlying data sources; several potentially relevant indicators, such as enforcement intensity or commodity‑specific trade flows, are not consistently available for all countries and decades and are therefore not included in the analysis panels.

These constraints point to priorities for future research. Extending the analysis to include additional years as data become available would allow for more flexible panel‑data models and a richer characterisation of temporal dynamics. Linking the national‑level indicators used here to subnational land‑use change datasets could help to uncover within‑country heterogeneity in the relationships between forest change, energy systems and emissions. Combining the aggregate perspective with more detailed studies of policies, enforcement and governance could shed further light on the institutional conditions under which energy‑sector decarbonisation and reductions in land‑use emissions can proceed in tandem. Finally, continued efforts to harmonise and integrate energy, land‑use and emissions data will be essential for monitoring progress towards SDG 7, SDG 13 and SDG 15 in South America.

Within these limitations, the present study contributes a region‑wide, empirically grounded perspective on the forest–energy–emissions nexus in South America. It shows that energy‑sector decarbonisation and land‑use emissions have followed distinct, though interconnected, trajectories over the past two decades, and it highlights the importance of considering both dimensions when evaluating climate performance and designing mitigation strategies. For policy makers and stakeholders in the region, the results suggest that sustained progress towards climate and development goals will require simultaneous attention to clean energy transitions, forest conservation and the structure of agricultural and land‑using sectors, supported by strong institutions and transparent data.
