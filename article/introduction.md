# Introduction

South America occupies a distinctive position in the global climate system. The region hosts some of the world’s largest remaining tropical forests and associated carbon stocks, while at the same time supplying land‑intensive commodities such as soybeans, beef and minerals to global markets. Over the past two decades, South American economies have navigated periods of rapid commodity‑driven growth and subsequent slowdowns, during which the tension between conserving forest ecosystems and expanding export‑oriented production has become increasingly visible. This tension is particularly pronounced in countries where forest‑rich biomes underpin both biodiversity and hydrological regulation, and where land‑use change and forestry still account for a substantial share of total greenhouse gas emissions (Carter et al., 2018; Nyawira et al., 2024).

Conventional indicators used to track climate performance typically focus on fossil CO₂ emissions and their relationship to economic output. A widely used example is the indicator of fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity, which is reported by CEPALSTAT and other agencies for South American countries and interpreted as a measure of the carbon intensity of economic activity (Peng et al., 2024). Such indicators are informative about energy‑sector decarbonisation, especially in regions where electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuels. However, in South America, where hydropower and other low‑carbon sources play a central role in many national electricity systems, and where land‑use, land‑use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions are large, focusing exclusively on fossil CO₂ intensity creates a potential blind spot. Countries can appear to decarbonise their economies when measured by fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, even as forest loss and associated land‑use emissions continue.

At the same time, land‑use dynamics in South America are shaped by a complex interplay of domestic policies, global demand and structural economic change. Research on global economic and diet transitions shows that shifting consumption patterns and external demand for agricultural commodities have contributed to forest loss in Latin America and the Caribbean (López‑Carr et al., 2022). Studies of land‑use change and emissions in Brazil and other countries in the region highlight the central role of agriculture‑driven deforestation, cattle production and commodity frontiers in explaining national LULUCF trajectories (Rodrigues et al., 2023; Sandoval & Burkart, 2023; Sanquetta et al., 2020). Scenario‑based analyses of Brazil’s Forest Code and national mitigation pathways show that legal frameworks, enforcement and land‑use policies can significantly alter future emission trajectories and trade‑offs between agricultural production and environmental conservation (Köberle et al., 2020; Soterroni et al., 2018; Wiltshire et al., 2022). Against this background, understanding how forest change, land‑use emissions and energy‑related emissions co‑evolve at the national level is a prerequisite for designing effective and coherent mitigation strategies in South America.

An additional dimension arises from the interaction between forests, the hydrological cycle and hydropower‑dependent energy systems. Several South American countries rely heavily on hydropower for electricity generation, and changes in precipitation patterns and river flows have direct implications for energy security and decarbonisation pathways. Studies of the 2015–2016 megadrought in Colombia, for example, show how extreme drought events can stress hydropower systems and catalyse adjustments in the energy mix (Weng et al., 2020). Research on trade‑offs and synergies between climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation and agro‑economic development in Brazil, as well as on land conservation and the renewable energy transition, points to the need to consider water, energy, land and biodiversity jointly when evaluating mitigation options (Gérard et al., 2025; Borba et al., 2024). In this context, large‑scale forest loss in South America is not only a source of land‑use emissions, but may also affect the hydrological foundations of hydropower and, indirectly, the prospects for maintaining low‑carbon electricity systems.

Despite this interconnectedness, national and regional assessments often treat energy‑related emissions and land‑use emissions separately. Energy‑system analyses emphasise the role of renewable energy deployment, technological innovation and structural change in reducing fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of output (Machado et al., 2020; Raihan, 2023), while land‑use studies focus on deforestation, agricultural expansion and associated LULUCF emissions (Carter et al., 2018; Nyawira et al., 2024; Roman‑Cuesta et al., 2016). Emission accounting and driver studies for South American countries demonstrate that both components are important for national greenhouse gas profiles (Peng et al., 2024), but systematic analyses that examine how forest area, LULUCF emissions, energy mixes and fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP co‑evolve across countries and over time remain relatively scarce. This gap is particularly relevant for South America, where many countries report relatively low fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP compared to other regions, while still experiencing substantial forest loss and land‑use change.

This article addresses this gap by analysing the co‑evolution of forest area, fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, LULUCF emissions and the electricity mix in twelve South American countries—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela—over the period 2000–2020. Using harmonised country–year data from CEPALSTAT, the World Bank and FAOSTAT, we construct a small panel with three benchmark years (2000, 2010 and 2020) and define decadal changes for two intervals (2000–2010 and 2010–2020). We then relate decadal changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP to changes in forest area, the hydropower share of electricity generation and GDP per capita, and decadal changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions to changes in forest area and the agriculture value added share of GDP. In addition, we use simple regional groupings of countries to highlight how these relationships play out across different structural contexts, including agricultural Southern Cone economies and Andean and Amazon‑frontier countries.

The study contributes to the literature in three main ways. First, it provides a comparative, region‑wide assessment of how fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP and per‑capita LULUCF emissions evolve in parallel in South America, and how they relate to changes in forest area, energy mixes and economic structure. Second, it illustrates empirically how reliance on fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP as a sole indicator of climate performance can obscure ongoing land‑use emissions in forest‑rich economies, thereby underscoring the importance of integrating land‑use emissions into assessments of mitigation progress. Third, it situates these empirical findings within the broader context of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land), and it points to tensions and potential synergies with SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The remainder of the article is organised as follows. The Methods section describes the construction of the country–year and decadal‑change panels, the variables used and the regression models. The Results section presents descriptive patterns and regression findings for fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, per‑capita LULUCF emissions and the electricity mix. The Discussion interprets these findings in light of existing literature and the Sustainable Development Goals, and identifies limitations and priorities for future research. The Conclusion summarises the main messages and outlines implications for climate and land‑use policy in South America.
