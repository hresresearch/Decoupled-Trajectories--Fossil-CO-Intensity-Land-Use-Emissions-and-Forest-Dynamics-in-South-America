Fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP in South America declined mainly with changes in the electricity mix and income, not with decadal changes in forest area.

Per‑capita LULUCF emission changes are closely linked to forest loss and to shifts in agriculture’s share of GDP.

Regional country clusters show that low or declining fossil CO₂ intensity can coexist with substantial or mixed forest trends.

Standard climate indicators based only on fossil CO₂ intensity may overstate mitigation progress in forest‑rich economies where land‑use emissions remain high.

Mitigation strategies in South America need to integrate clean energy transitions, forest conservation and agricultural development in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.
