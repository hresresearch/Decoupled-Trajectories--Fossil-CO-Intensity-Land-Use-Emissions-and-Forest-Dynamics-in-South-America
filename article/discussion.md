# Discussion

This study examined how changes in forest area, land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions and the electricity mix relate to the fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP in twelve South American countries over the period 2000–2020. The empirical results point to two central patterns. First, fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of economic output declined in most countries, and these reductions are statistically associated with changes in the electricity mix and income growth rather than with changes in forest area. Second, per‑capita LULUCF emissions remain closely linked to forest area dynamics and the economic role of agriculture. In this section, we interpret these findings in light of the existing literature, discuss their implications for the Sustainable Development Goals and highlight limitations and priorities for future research.

The cluster perspective introduced in the Results section helps to situate these patterns in the region’s heterogeneous development pathways. The agricultural Southern Cone group illustrates that low fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, supported by hydropower and non‑hydropower renewables, can coexist with substantial forest loss and associated land‑use emissions. The Andean and Amazon‑frontier group combines more diversified energy mixes, higher average fossil CO₂ intensity and continued forest dynamics at the extractive and agricultural frontiers. The small residual group of Chile, Guyana and Suriname exhibits intermediate or mixed profiles. These groupings are heuristic and descriptive, but they underscore that similar statistical relationships between decadal changes in the electricity mix, forest area and emissions can have different policy implications depending on the structural context.

The decadal regressions indicate that increases in the hydropower share of electricity generation and rise in GDP per capita at purchasing power parity are associated with reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, while decadal percentage changes in forest area are not significantly associated with changes in CO₂ intensity once energy and income dynamics are controlled for. This pattern is consistent with country‑specific scenario and policy analyses that emphasise the centrality of the energy system for mitigation in South America. Studies of Brazil’s mitigation pathways in a well‑below‑2 °C world and the relative role of disruptive technologies versus land‑based mitigation point to a comparatively low‑emission electricity system and stress that further emission reductions in Brazil depend on both technological change and land‑use policies in a broader decarbonisation strategy (Köberle et al., 2020). Work on the potential of a bioeconomy to reduce Brazilian emissions towards 2030 underlines that changes in the energy mix, energy efficiency and structural economic change are important determinants of future emission trajectories (Machado et al., 2020). At the same time, country‑level analyses for Chile and Colombia emphasise the influence of renewable energy deployment, technological innovation and integration into global markets on emission reduction prospects (Raihan, 2023). Against this background, our finding that decadal reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity are associated with changes in the electricity mix and income growth aligns with the view that energy‑system decarbonisation is a primary channel through which South American countries reduce fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of output.

At the same time, the absence of a statistically significant association between decadal percentage changes in forest area and changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP does not imply that forest dynamics are irrelevant for national mitigation strategies. Instead, it reflects the fact that fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP is largely determined by fossil‑fuel use in energy and industry, while forest change affects a different component of the greenhouse gas balance. The literature on agriculture‑driven deforestation and associated emissions in the tropics shows that land‑use change contributes substantially to total emissions but primarily through the LULUCF component rather than through energy‑related CO₂ (Carter et al., 2018). Work on global and pantropical AFOLU emissions and removals similarly documents the large contribution of land‑use emissions to national and regional greenhouse gas budgets, particularly in forest‑rich tropical countries (Nyawira et al., 2024; Houghton & Castanho, 2023). Our results fit into this picture by showing that, for the twelve South American countries considered here, energy‑related CO₂ intensity of GDP can improve even as forest area declines, while LULUCF emissions per capita remain directly connected to forest area dynamics.

Country‑specific examples from the agricultural Southern Cone group illustrate the limitations of focusing solely on fossil CO₂ intensity. Paraguay maintains an almost entirely hydropower‑based electricity mix and correspondingly low fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, yet its fossil CO₂ intensity increased slightly between 2010 and 2020 and the country experienced sizeable forest losses over both decades. Brazil records substantial reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity between 2000 and 2010 and stable intensity thereafter, alongside a decline in the hydropower share of electricity generation and continued, though slowing, forest loss. Uruguay and Chile, in turn, combine increases in reported forest area with rapid growth in non‑hydropower renewable electricity. Taken together, these cases show that favourable trends in fossil CO₂ intensity can coincide with continued forest loss or with forest gains that reflect complex mixes of natural and managed forests, and they highlight the importance of treating energy‑related and land‑use emissions as complementary rather than interchangeable dimensions of climate performance.

The close association between decadal changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions, forest area and the agriculture share of GDP that we observe in the data is consistent with a large body of work on the drivers of deforestation and land‑use emissions in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Studies that examine the role of land‑use emissions in achieving Brazil’s nationally determined contribution highlight that continued reductions in land‑use and agricultural emissions are essential for meeting national mitigation targets and that policy choices on deforestation control and agricultural expansion have long‑lasting implications for the LULUCF trajectory (Wiltshire et al., 2022). Analyses of reductions in land‑use change and agricultural emissions in Brazil in the context of the country’s commitments under the Paris Agreement document that policy interventions and enforcement can substantially alter deforestation trends and associated emissions (Ferreira‑Filho & Horridge, 2016). Scenario‑based assessments of Brazil’s Forest Code indicate that legal and institutional frameworks governing land use can affect both environmental outcomes and agricultural production over coming decades (Soterroni et al., 2018). Our finding that decadal LULUCF emission changes are closely associated with forest area dynamics and changes in the agriculture share of GDP is consistent with these studies and emphasises that the structure of the economy and land‑use policy continue to shape the land‑use emissions pathway.

Recent work on agricultural production, livestock and GHG emissions in the Brazilian Amazon and broader Latin America further supports the connection between agricultural expansion, cattle production, land‑use change and emissions (Rodrigues et al., 2023; Sandoval & Burkart, 2023). Studies of global economic and diet transitions and their effects on Latin American and Caribbean forest change highlight the role of changing consumption patterns and external demand for agricultural commodities in driving forest loss (López‑Carr et al., 2022). Evidence on greenhouse gas emissions from land‑use change in Brazil between 1990 and 2015 shows that land‑use change remains a major contributor to national emissions despite progress in other sectors (Sanquetta et al., 2020). Together with these contributions, our results reinforce the view that forest loss and agricultural expansion are tightly linked to LULUCF emissions, and that improvements in energy‑sector emissions do not automatically resolve the land‑use component of national greenhouse gas inventories.

The relationship between land‑use policies, deforestation control and broader development objectives has direct implications for the Sustainable Development Goals. Our findings speak most directly to SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 13 on climate action and SDG 15 on life on land, but they are also connected to SDG 2 on zero hunger and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions. The observed decline in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, associated with changes in the electricity mix and progress in access to electricity, is broadly aligned with SDG 7 and SDG 13, which call for expanded access to modern energy services and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, the persistence of forest loss and its tight link to per‑capita LULUCF emissions indicates that SDG 15, which aims to halt deforestation and reverse land degradation, remains under pressure in several countries. The association between changes in the agriculture share of GDP and LULUCF emissions illustrates the tensions and potential synergies between SDG 2 and SDG 13: increasing agricultural production to improve food security and export revenues can come at the cost of higher land‑use emissions if it is achieved through area expansion rather than intensification and improved practices.

Our use of governance and social indicators from CEPALSTAT, including measures of control of corruption, rule of law, income inequality and rural extreme poverty, underscores the relevance of SDG 16. Although the small sample and limited temporal coverage prevent formal estimation of governance effects in our decadal regression models, the descriptive variation in these indicators across countries points to substantial differences in institutional capacity and social outcomes. Studies that examine wood production and its correlation with socioeconomic and environmental indicators in the Amazon region, as well as research on regional development and greenhouse gas emissions in Amazonian states, highlight that institutional quality and enforcement play a central role in mediating the relationship between economic development, land‑use change and emissions (Silva et al., 2023; Imori et al., 2016). Work on hotspots of land‑use emissions and comparisons of land‑use emission datasets further points to the importance of consistent and transparent monitoring for effective governance (Roman‑Cuesta et al., 2016). In this broader context, our descriptive use of governance indicators suggests that meeting SDG 13 and SDG 15 in South America will depend not only on technical mitigation options in energy and land use, but also on institutional strength and social conditions.

The distinction between fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP and land‑use emissions per capita that emerges from our results is also important for how climate performance is assessed. Emission accounting and driver analyses for South American countries emphasise that both energy‑related emissions and LULUCF emissions contribute to national greenhouse gas profiles (Peng et al., 2024). Pantropical assessments of AFOLU emissions and removals and LULUCF datasets based on national greenhouse gas inventories show that land‑use emissions account for a large share of net emissions in many tropical countries and that their temporal dynamics differ from those of energy‑related emissions (Nyawira et al., 2024; LULUCF data based on national inventories, 2022). If climate performance is evaluated solely through indicators such as CO₂ emissions per unit of GDP, countries that have reduced fossil CO₂ intensity while continuing to lose forest area may appear to perform better than their total emissions trajectories warrant. Our results provide a concrete illustration of this concern for South America, where energy‑sector decarbonisation and land‑use emissions follow different trajectories.

The heterogeneity of energy‑system pathways in the region also has implications for resilience to climate impacts and for hydropower‑dependent systems. Studies of the 2015–2016 megadrought in Colombia and its implications for energy transitions emphasise the interactions between climate variability, hydropower reliance and energy‑system change (Weng et al., 2020). The literature on trade‑offs and synergies between climate change mitigation, biodiversity preservation and agro‑economic development in Brazil and on land conservation under a renewable energy transition suggests that mitigation strategies need to account for cross‑sectoral linkages between water, energy, land and biodiversity (Gérard et al., 2025; Borba et al., 2024). Our finding that hydropower expansion is associated with reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity highlights the benefits of low‑carbon electricity for SDG 7 and SDG 13, but attention to hydrological risks and ecosystem impacts remains important to avoid unintended consequences for SDG 6 on water and SDG 15 on terrestrial ecosystems.

This study has several limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, the empirical analysis is based on twelve countries and three benchmark years, which implies that the number of country–decade observations in the delta panel is small. This restricts the complexity of regression specifications that can be estimated without over‑fitting and limits the precision of coefficient estimates. Second, the analysis relies on nationally aggregated data from international statistical agencies. While these data provide a consistent basis for cross‑country comparison, they cannot capture subnational heterogeneity in land‑use change, energy systems or governance, which is known to be important in large and diverse countries such as Brazil, Colombia or Peru. Third, the decadal‑difference specification controls for time‑invariant country characteristics and focuses on medium‑term changes, but it cannot identify causal effects of forest change, hydropower expansion or income growth on emissions outcomes. The estimated coefficients should therefore be interpreted as conditional associations rather than structural parameters.

Fourth, the variable set is constrained by the coverage of the underlying data sources. Several potentially relevant indicators, such as detailed innovation metrics, commodity‑specific trade data or measures of enforcement intensity, are not available with sufficient coverage across countries and time to be included in the decadal models. Even within the available data, some series related to methane or total CO₂ emissions are not consistently reported in the current versions of the World Bank or FAOSTAT databases, which is why they are excluded from our analysis panels. Finally, the regression models do not explicitly incorporate price dynamics, international demand or policy shocks, which play a central role in many country‑specific studies of deforestation and energy transitions. As a result, the models cannot account for all relevant drivers of emission changes and should be seen as a complementary, region‑wide perspective rather than as a replacement for detailed national case studies.

These limitations suggest several directions for future research. One avenue is to extend the analysis with more frequent temporal data as additional years become available and to explore panel‑data models that combine decadal and annual information. Another is to integrate subnational land‑use change datasets with national energy and macroeconomic indicators to better capture within‑country heterogeneity, building on work that compares bottom‑up estimates of land‑use emissions with top‑down atmospheric measurements in the Amazon and other tropical regions (Tejada et al., 2023). A third direction is to link the aggregate indicators used here to more detailed analyses of policies, enforcement and governance, drawing on national greenhouse gas inventories and case studies of specific biomes or commodity frontiers. Such work would enable a more explicit treatment of SDG 16 and of the institutional dimensions of land‑use and energy transitions.

Within these constraints, the present study contributes a region‑wide, empirically grounded perspective on how energy‑sector decarbonisation and land‑use emissions evolve in South America and how they relate to forest area and economic structure. The evidence that fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP can decline through changes in the electricity mix and structural change, while LULUCF emissions per capita remain closely tied to forest loss and agriculture, underscores the need for integrated mitigation strategies that simultaneously address SDG 7, SDG 13 and SDG 15. It also highlights the importance of considering land‑use emissions explicitly when assessing climate performance and designing policies that aim to reconcile climate mitigation, biodiversity conservation and agricultural development in the region. These themes are taken up in more detail in the Conclusion section, where we synthesise the implications of the empirical findings and outline policy‑relevant messages for decision‑makers in South America and beyond.
