# Results

This section presents empirical results on the evolution of fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP, land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions, and the electricity mix in South America between 2000 and 2020. We first summarise descriptive patterns in levels and decadal changes. We then report regression results that relate changes in fossil CO₂ intensity and per‑capita LULUCF emissions to changes in forest area, the energy mix and economic structure. All findings are based on the analysis panels described in the Methods section.

## Descriptive patterns in levels and decadal changes

Fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity declined in most South American countries over the study period. Between 2000 and 2020, the regional mean CO₂ intensity of GDP fell, with particularly pronounced reductions in countries that expanded hydropower and non‑hydropower renewables in their electricity mix. The decline in CO₂ intensity was not uniform: some countries exhibited large proportional reductions, while others showed relatively modest changes, but the overall pattern points to gradual decarbonisation of economic output.

Forest area trajectories were heterogeneous across countries. Several countries in the region experienced net losses of forest area, especially those with large tropical forest frontiers and expanding agricultural frontiers. Others exhibited comparatively stable forest area or modest gains, reflecting different national land‑use policies and economic dynamics. When expressed as percentage changes over each decade, forest area declined in a substantial share of country–period observations, with larger relative losses in the early 2000–2010 decade than in the subsequent decade for some countries.

LULUCF emissions remained substantial throughout the period and exhibited marked variation across countries and over time. Countries with extensive deforestation or land‑use change in forested regions tended to have high absolute LULUCF emissions, while countries with smaller forest areas or more stable land use had lower totals. When expressed per capita, LULUCF emissions reveal sharp contrasts between countries with high rates of land‑use change and those with more limited land‑use dynamics. In several cases, per‑capita LULUCF emissions declined over time, while in others they remained elevated or increased, reflecting persistent or renewed land‑use pressures.

Economic and structural indicators show rising GDP per capita for most countries over 2000–2020, albeit from different starting levels. In several countries, the agriculture share of GDP declined, consistent with broader patterns of structural transformation towards industry and services. In others, agriculture retained a sizable share of economic output, often in tandem with expanding agricultural land. These differences in economic structure provide important context for interpreting the links between forest change, land‑use emissions and energy‑related decarbonisation.

The electricity mix evolved towards higher shares of hydropower and, in some cases, non‑hydropower renewables, although the extent and direction of change varied across countries. Some countries increased their reliance on hydropower from already high levels, while others expanded fossil‑fuel based generation from coal or natural gas. Access to electricity improved across the region, with increases in the share of the population connected to the grid. Taken together, these changes suggest that energy‑sector decarbonisation and energy access have progressed, but along distinct pathways across the twelve countries.

To highlight this heterogeneity we use a simple clustering of countries that is reflected in the decadal scatterplots. Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay form an agricultural Southern Cone group characterised by large agricultural sectors and substantial forest resources. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela form an Andean and Amazon‑frontier group with mixed hydrocarbon, extractive and agricultural activities. Chile, Guyana and Suriname constitute a small and diverse residual group. The clusters are used only for descriptive purposes and provide a convenient way to visualise how combinations of forest change, fossil CO₂ intensity and LULUCF emissions differ across regional development patterns.

## Changes in fossil CO₂ intensity and the electricity mix

Decadal changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP show that most country–decade observations experienced reductions in CO₂ intensity. The magnitude of these reductions differs substantially, with some countries exhibiting pronounced declines over both decades and others showing more modest progress or near‑stagnation in one of the decades. These patterns are consistent with gradual improvements in energy efficiency, shifts towards lower‑carbon energy sources and changes in the sectoral composition of output.

The decadal change in the hydropower share of electricity generation is positively associated with reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP. Country–periods in which the hydropower share increased tend to exhibit larger decreases in CO₂ intensity, while those with declining or stagnant hydropower shares show smaller improvements. In the regression model for decadal changes in fossil CO₂ intensity (Table 6, Model A), the coefficient on the change in hydropower share is negative and statistically significant (β ≈ −0.001, p ≈ 0.001 with heteroskedasticity‑consistent standard errors). Changes in GDP per capita also matter: higher income growth is associated with reductions in CO₂ intensity, with a small negative coefficient on the change in GDP per capita (β ≈ −5.6×10⁻⁶, p ≈ 0.02). These results are consistent with the idea that structural change and investment in cleaner technologies can accompany economic development.

Changes in forest area, as measured by the percentage change in forest area over each decade, do not exhibit a statistically significant association with changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP in the decadal regressions. The estimated coefficient on percentage change in forest area is close to zero and not statistically significant at conventional levels (β ≈ −0.0005, p ≈ 0.38). Countries that experienced substantial forest loss did not systematically show larger decreases or increases in fossil CO₂ intensity than countries with stable or increasing forest area, once changes in hydropower share and GDP per capita are taken into account. This suggests that, over the time frame and spatial scale considered here, the main drivers of observed changes in CO₂ intensity of GDP are located within the energy system and broader economic structure rather than in forest area dynamics.

The clustered scatterplots illustrate how this pattern plays out in different regional settings. In the agricultural Southern Cone group, countries such as Brazil and Paraguay combine relatively low levels of fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP with sizeable forest losses over one or both decades. Paraguay, for example, maintained an almost entirely hydropower‑based electricity mix and correspondingly low fossil CO₂ intensity, yet its CO₂ intensity increased slightly between 2010 and 2020. In the Andean and Amazon‑frontier group, fossil CO₂ intensity levels are generally higher and energy mixes more diversified, while forest area changes range from moderate losses to more pronounced declines. The residual group of Chile, Guyana and Suriname spans a wide range of combinations of forest change and fossil CO₂ intensity. These examples underscore that improvements in fossil CO₂ intensity can coexist with continued forest loss and that the absence of a statistical association between forest change and CO₂ intensity reflects differences in sectoral and energy‑system structures rather than a lack of environmental relevance of forests.

## Changes in LULUCF emissions per capita and forest dynamics

The decadal behaviour of per‑capita LULUCF emissions differs from the patterns observed for fossil CO₂ intensity. In the subset of countries and decades with complete data, changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions are closely linked to changes in forest area. Country–periods with greater forest loss, as indicated by more negative percentage changes in forest area, tend to exhibit larger increases in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. Conversely, country–periods characterised by stable or modestly increasing forest area are more likely to show stable or declining per‑capita LULUCF emissions.

Regression models that relate decadal changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions to percentage changes in forest area and changes in the agriculture value added share of GDP confirm this pattern. In the LULUCF model (Table 6, Model B), the estimated coefficient on percentage change in forest area is positive and statistically significant (β ≈ 0.33, p < 0.001), with the convention that more negative values correspond to larger forest losses. This indicates that greater forest loss is associated with higher increases in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. Changes in the agriculture value added share of GDP are negatively associated with changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions: the coefficient on the change in the agriculture share is negative and significant (β ≈ −0.49, p ≈ 0.001), and country–periods in which the agriculture share of GDP declines tend to experience more favourable LULUCF emission outcomes in the sense of smaller increases or larger reductions in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. These associations persist when using cluster‑robust standard errors by country and when re‑estimating the models while leaving out one country at a time, within the limitations of the small sample size. Together, these findings suggest that both forest area dynamics and the economic role of agriculture are closely connected to the evolution of land‑use emissions per capita.

The country clusters provide additional context for interpreting these associations. On average, the agricultural Southern Cone and the Andean and Amazon‑frontier groups both exhibit declines in forest area over the two decades, accompanied by moderate reductions in per‑capita LULUCF emissions, while the small residual group shows, on average, slight forest area gains and increases in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. Within each cluster, however, individual country–periods deviate from these averages, and the overall pattern remains that greater forest loss within a given structural context is associated with less favourable changes in per‑capita LULUCF emissions. The cluster perspective therefore complements the regression analysis by illustrating how similar mechanisms operate across different regional development profiles.

## Changes in the electricity mix and energy‑system decarbonisation

To place the decadal results in the broader context of energy‑system change, we summarise shifts in the electricity mix between 2000 and 2020. Several countries increased the share of hydropower in electricity generation over the two decades, often starting from already high levels. In others, hydropower shares remained broadly stable, while coal‑ or gas‑based generation expanded. Non‑hydropower renewables, such as wind and solar, grew from near‑zero levels in 2000 to measurable shares in some countries by 2020, although their contribution to the regional electricity mix remained limited relative to hydropower and fossil fuels.

The countries that achieved the largest reductions in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP over 2000–2020 generally combined rising hydropower shares, growing non‑hydropower renewables and increases in GDP per capita. Countries where fossil‑fuel based generation expanded without compensating increases in low‑carbon generation tended to experience smaller reductions in CO₂ intensity, even when GDP per capita grew. These patterns underscore the central role of the electricity mix in driving changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of output.

## Summary of key empirical findings

Across the twelve South American countries considered, fossil CO₂ emissions per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity declined between 2000 and 2020, with the magnitude of reductions varying across countries and decades. Regression models indicate that these reductions are significantly associated with increases in the hydropower share of electricity generation and with gains in GDP per capita, whereas percentage changes in forest area do not exhibit a statistically significant association with decadal changes in fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP once energy and income dynamics are taken into account.

In contrast, land‑use, land‑use change and forestry emissions per capita are closely linked to forest area dynamics and the economic role of agriculture. Countries and decades with larger relative forest losses tend to show greater increases in per‑capita LULUCF emissions, while declines in the agriculture share of GDP are associated with more favourable LULUCF emission trajectories. These patterns are consistent across ordinary least squares estimates with heteroskedasticity‑consistent and cluster‑robust standard errors and remain qualitatively similar in leave‑one‑country‑out analyses, subject to the constraints imposed by the small sample.

Taken together, the results show that energy‑sector decarbonisation and land‑use emissions follow distinct trajectories in South America. It appears feasible to reduce fossil CO₂ intensity of GDP through changes in the electricity mix and structural economic change, even in the presence of continued forest loss. At the same time, forest loss remains tightly linked to per‑capita LULUCF emissions, indicating that improvements in energy‑related emissions do not automatically translate into improvements in land‑use emissions. These empirical findings motivate the Discussion and Conclusion sections, where we interpret the results in light of the Sustainable Development Goals and the broader literature on decarbonisation and land‑use change.
